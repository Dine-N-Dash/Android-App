# Dine-N-Dash

Dine-N-Dash is an app designed to make splitting the bill at restaurants easy.

It uses the [Firebase Text Recongnition API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/recognize-text) to construct a list of items from an image of a receipt.

Users can then assign those receipt items to people in their contacts and send them an SMS requesting payment via [PayPal.me](https://www.paypal.me/)

In addition, Dine-N-Dash uses a [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/) on the backend to keep a history of past transactions
